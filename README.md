# sound-of-sorting
Apply sorting algorithms to a waveform and listen to it as it sorts

Hello chaos, my old friend
I've come to get rid of you again
Because a random number engine
Left its seed while init'lizing
And the entropy was planted in Markov chains
Still remains
Within the sound of sorting

In Minecraft worlds I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the root of a heap tree
I swapped subtrees to the left and right
When my ears were stabbed by the chirp of white noise
I rejoiced
And produced the sound of sorting

And in the memory I saw
Ten thousand samples, maybe more
People coding without typing
People debugging without breaking
People writing code that compilers never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of sorting
