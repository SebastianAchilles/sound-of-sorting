# The Sound of Sorting
Apply sorting algorithms to a waveform and listen to it as it sorts

> Hello chaos, my old friend</br>
> I've come to get rid of you again</br>
> Because a random num-ber engine</br>
> Left its seed while init'lizing</br>
> And the entropy was planted in Markov chains</br>
> Still remains</br>
> Within the sound of sorting</br>
> 
> In Minecraft worlds I walked alone</br>
> Narrow streets of cobblestone</br>
> 'Neath the root of an ordered heap</br>
> I swapped its subtrees for quite cheap</br>
> When my ears were stabbed by the chirp of white noise</br>
> I rejoiced</br>
> And produced the sound of sorting</br>
> 
> And in the memory I saw</br>
> Ten thousand samples, maybe more</br>
> People codin' without typin'</br>
> People debuggin' without breakin'</br>
> People writing code that through github they share</br>
> And no one dared</br>
> Disturb the sound of sorting</br>
